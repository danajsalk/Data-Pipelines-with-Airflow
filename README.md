# Data Pipelines with Airflow
<br>

## Project Overview
<br>

This project will introduces the core concepts of Apache Airflow. This creates custom operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.

Four empty operators are implemented into functional pieces of a data pipeline and also contains a set of linked tasks to achieve a coherent and sensible data flow within the pipeline.

The ETL is executed with custom operators.

The project contains three major components:
1. The **dag** has all the imports and task templates in place
2. The **operators** folder with operator templates
3. A **helper class** for the SQL transformations


## Operators
<br>

**Stage Operator**
The stage operator loads any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters specify where in S3 the file is loaded and what is the target table.


**Fact and Dimension Operators**
With dimension and fact operators, utilizes the provided SQL helper class to run data transformations. Most of the logic is within the SQL transformations and the operator is expected to take as input a SQL statement and target database on which to run the query against. A target table that will contain the results of the transformation.

**Data Quality Operator**
The final operator is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result is checked and if there is no match, the operator raises an exception and the task retries and eventually fails.


## Source Data
<br>

The source data is in log files given the Amazon S3 bucket.


* Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
* Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

    
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON 
format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned 
by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

Log files contains songplay events of the users in json format 
while song_data contains list of songs details.

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based 
on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music 
streaming app based on configuration settings. The log files in the dataset are partitioned by 
year and month.

## Database Schema
<br>

Using the song and event datasets, a star schema is created and optimized for queries on 
song play analysis. Following are the fact and dimension tables made for this project:

#### Fact Table:
* **songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    * columns: songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
        
#### Dimension Tables:
* **users** - users in the app
    * columns: user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
* **songs** - songs in music database
    * columns: song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
* **artists** - artists in music database
    * columns: artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
* **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    * columns: start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Run Directions:
<br>

* Update the `dwh.cfg` file
    * Amazon Redshift cluster credentials
    * IAM role
* Run `python create_tables.py`. 
    * This will create the database and all the required tables.
* Run `python etl.py`. 
    * This will start pipeline which will read the data from files and populate the tables.
